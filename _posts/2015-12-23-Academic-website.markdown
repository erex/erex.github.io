After years of using *university-sanctioned* websites, we have been asked to move our personal websites off of university hardware.  I chose to use Github as a free-hosting solution.  In addition, I use Github for most of my collaborative software projects, so using the same platform for website development required one less learning curve to climb.

Expect future (infrequent) blog posts perhaps on topics of distance sampling tips-and-tricks.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight r %}
web <- runif(100)
hist(web)
{% endhighlight %}
